  4) Click overview
  5) Click create worker
  6) Name it whatever you want
  7) Click deploy
  8) Click edit code
  9) In this repo there is the CF folder and HTML folder, in the CF folder copy all the code inside the worker.js file.
  10) paste the code in & click save and deploy
  11) Copy the URL and save it since it will be needed.
  12) Next eather use cloudflare pages (recommened) or any other hosting site of your choice for static hosting such as netlify or github pages
